		["[SD] Headhunter", "1pt for each enemy ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ that is destroyed."],
		["[SD] Born for Greatness", "Pick one of your single model ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ units. This unit gains 1pt for accomplishing each of the following objectives up to a total of 4pts. Each objective can only be achieved once per game.\n- Destroy an enemy unit that does not have the ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ keyword.\n- Destroy an enemy unit that has the ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ keyword.\n- Deny an enemy Psychic Power.\n- Hold an objective outside of your deployment zone.\n- Heroically intervene into an enemy unit.\n- Begin and end a Battle Round wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone."],
		["[SD] Marked for Death", "Choose 4 of your opponent’s units each of which is worth a points value including wargear of 120 or more points. Earn 1 pt for each of these units destroyed.\n- In order to score this point against a unit that splits into multiple units during the course of play, you must destroy each individual component unit. If a unit joins with another unit during the course of play, to earn this point you must destroy the entire conjoined unit."],
		["[SD] Gang Busters", "For every 6 wounds inflicted on a non Troop battlefield role multi-model unit composed entirely of models with 3 or more wounds that does not have the Vehicle, Swarms or Monster keywords, score 1 point.\n- Once any wounds from a unit are counted towards your Gang Busters Secondary Objective, that unit may not score points for another Seek and Destroy Secondary Objective."],
		["[SD] Big Game Hunter", "Earn 1 point for every 10 cumulative wounds dealt to enemy units containing the ᴍᴏɴsᴛᴇʀ, ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ or ᴠᴇʜɪᴄʟᴇ keyword.\n- Once any wounds from a unit are counted towards your Big Game Hunters Secondary Objective, that unit may not score points for another Seek and Destroy Secondary Objective."],
		["[SD] The Butcher’s Bill", "Destroy 2+ enemy units during a player turn to earn 1 Point."],
		["[SD] The Reaper", "For every 20 wounds of ɪɴғᴀɴᴛʀʏ, sᴡᴀʀᴍs, ʙɪᴋᴇʀs or ᴅʀᴏɴᴇ models destroyed, earn 1 point.\n- You count each wound when the Infantry model is destroyed. In the instance of models coming back into play after being destroyed during the course of a game, you may count them each time they are destroyed.\n- Once a model is removed from a unit, if you choose to count it towards your Reaper Secondary Objective, that unit may not score points for another Seek and Destroy Secondary Objective."],
		["[M] Recon", "Have a unit at least partially in each table quarter at the end of your player turn. A unit may only count as being in one table quarter at a time for the purposes of this rule. 1pt per turn. Starting turn 2, if you have two units in every table quarter, you earn 2pts per turn."],
		["[M] Behind Enemy Lines", "If at least one of your units that does not have the Flyer battlefield role is wholly within the enemy Deployment Zone at the end of your turn, earn 1 Point. Starting turn 2 and on, if you have three or more non-Flyer battlefield role units wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone at the end of your turn, you earn 2pts."],
		["[M] Ground Control", "Earn 1 point for each objective held at the end of the last Battle Round played. If you hold all of the objectives on the table at game’s end, you score all 4pts."],
		["[M] King of the Hill", "At the end of their turn, the player who chose this secondary objective scores 1 point if they have two units that are any combination of non-character, multi-model units or units with the Titanic keyword wholly within 9 inches of the center of the table. Beginning in the second battle round, if the player who chose this secondary has four or more qualifying units wholly within 9 inches of the center of the table, that player instead scores 2 points. 'Multi-model unit' means a unit that consisted of more than a single model immediately prior to the start of the game."],
		["[M] Engineers", "Select two non-character/non-fortification units from your army to be Engineers. Starting from Battle Round 2, if one or more of these units starts and ends your turn within 3” of the same objective marker you control, and it did not make any attacks or manifest any psychic powers during your turn, earn 1 point at the end of that turn. If you have two Engineer units performing this role on two separate objectives and one or more of the objectives is outside of your deployment zone, earn 2pts. These units may not score this objective if they join other units during the course of play or split into multiple units. Units chosen to be Engineers may never benefit from a rule that keeps them from being the target of attacks, Cloud of Flies, for example. They can benefit from terrain blocking Line of Sight to them."],
		["[M] Sappers", "Select two non-character/non-fortification/non-Flyer battlefield role units from your army to be Sappers. So long as a Sapper unit ends your turn within 3” of an Objective outside of the controlling player’s deployment zone and made no attacks or attempted to manifest any psychic powers that turn, the Sapper unit may render the objective Unscorable for any primary or secondary objectives for the Sapper unit’s opponent so long as it remains in this state. Note, a Sapper may render an objective unscorable even if they do not control the objective. Once rendered Unscorable, an objective remains in this state until the Sapper moves more than 3” away from it, is destroyed, makes any attacks or manifests any psychic powers. If at the end of your turn your Sappers have rendered any objectives Unscorable, earn 1pt. Starting turn 2 and on, you can earn up to a maximum of 2pts per turn for Sapping two or more objectives. Units chosen to be Sappers may never benefit from a rule that keeps them from being the target of attacks, Cloud of Flies, for example. They can benefit from terrain blocking Line of Sight to them. If a Sapper unit ever splits into multiple units during the course of the game using an ability such as the Combat Squads rule or is combined into another unit such as with Consolidate Squads stratagem they are no longer Sapper units and lose all of the above abilities for the rest of the game."],
		["[M] The Postman", "Select a single model from your army that does not have the ᴠᴇʜɪᴄʟᴇ, ᴍᴏɴsᴛᴇʀ or ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ (with the exception of Imperial Knights and Chaos Knights which may be made The Postman) keywords to be The Postman (this model can be in a unit). This model may choose to gather intel on an Objective within 3” that you control at the end of your turn. You may only gather intel from each objective once per game. Earn 1pt per objective you gather intel from. If at the end of the game you have gathered intel from every objective on the table, you automatically score all 4pts."],
		["Old School", "Earn 1 point for the following:\n- First Strike: An enemy unit is destroyed in the first Battle Round.\n- Slay the Warlord: The enemy Warlord is destroyed at game’s end.\n- Linebreaker: Have one of your models within your opponent’s deployment zone at the end of the game.\n- Last Strike: An enemy unit is destroyed in the last Battle Round played."]
